**Alex’s portfolio**
The aim for this site is to display a professional profile in the best possible light, including areas of expertise, personal strengths, previous work experience and recommendations. It also provides a way for visitors to go download a CV, send a message and visit a linkedIn profile.
In the future, this site will also contain an overview of coding projects as well as links to a github portfolio.

<!-------------------------------------------------UX-------->
**UX**
The main purpose of the site is to be used as a professional reference or portfolio and is intended to be read by colleagues, recruiters or potentially customers. To add value for the user in comparison to LinkedIn profile, this site displays areas of expertise in a detail way as well as personal competences.
The information has been structured under the progressive disclosure principle, starting with a short introduction called “about-me” and systematically disclosing more detailed information. The “my-work” section describes the areas of expertise, while the following sections “my-skills”, “my-brands” and “recommendations” provide reassurance about the professional skills and competences to work within those areas of expertise. Finally, the “contact” section provides an option for the user to send a message and get in contact.
These are the actions the user can do on this site today:
    *Discovering the profile by scrolling through the sections.
    *Downloading a pdf-version of a CV.
    *Visiting a LinkedIn profile via a hyperlink.
    *Leaving a message.
    *Check the privacy policy and terms and conditions.
    *Use the navigation bar to move through the site and its different pages.

This site was built as a mobile-first site, therefore the selected layout has been one long layout with different sections which the user can scroll through. The navbar plays a secondary role here, and should guide the user whenever needed.

**User stories:**
    *A user wants to read more about the profile, scrolls down to the end of the page. Alternatively the user could click on an item of the navigation menu to jump to the section of their interest.
    *A user wants to download a printable PDF version of the profile’s CV. The user scrolls down to the section under Competences and clicks on the call-to-action in blue that says “Download my CV”. A new page opens in a new window, and the user can either read the PDF directly there or download it to their desktop.
    *A user is able to contact the site owner by filling out the contact form at the bottom of the page. After completing the required fields such as name, address and message, the user can click on the submit button to send their message.
    *A user wants to take a look at the privacy policy or terms and conditions of the page. The user can do so by scrolling down all the way down to the end of the page, in the footer the user can find a link to each of these pages. The user then can navigate back to the home page or index.html by using the buttom in the top left corner.
    *At any moment, when the user has scrolled to the bottom of the page, the user is able to use the ‘Back to top’ clickable text at the bottom right of the footer which will allow the user to jump to one of the top sections.
