Alex’s portfolio
The aim for this site is to display a professional profile in the best possible light, including areas of expertise, personal strengths, previous work experience and recommendations. It also provides a way for visitors to go download a CV, send a message and visit a linkedIn profile.
In the future, this site will also contain an overview of coding projects as well as links to a github portfolio.

<!-------------------------------------------------UX-------->
UX
The main purpose of the site is to be used as a professional reference or portfolio and is intended to be read by colleagues, recruiters or potentially customers. To add value for the user in comparison to LinkedIn profile, this site displays areas of expertise in a detail way as well as personal competences.
The information has been structured under the progressive disclosure principle, starting with a short introduction called “about-me” and systematically disclosing more detailed information. The “my-work” section describes the areas of expertise, while the following sections “my-skills”, “my-brands” and “recommendations” provide reassurance about the professional skills and competences to work within those areas of expertise. Finally, the “contact” section provides an option for the user to send a message and get in contact.
    These are the actions the user can do on this site today:
        x Discovering the profile by scrolling through the sections.
        x Downloading a pdf-version of a CV.
        x Visiting a LinkedIn profile via a hyperlink.
        x Leaving a message.
        x This site was built as a mobile-first site, therefore the selected layout has been one long layout with different sections which the user can scroll through. The navbar plays a secondary role here, and should guide the user whenever needed.
    
<!-------------------------------------------------MISSING-------->
In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:
As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.
This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.

<!-------------------------------------------------testing MISSING-------->
Testing
    I have tested the site by using the Google developer tools and tested the adaptability of the content to different devices. The site and all it’s styling elements displayed as expected in desktop as well as in the following mobile-devices: Galaxy 5s, Pixel 2, Pixel XL, iPhone 5/SE, iPhone 6/7/8, iPhone 6/7/8 Plus, iPhone X, iPad and iPad Pro.
    The navigation menu to scroll to different sections worked in all devices.

    In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.
    Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.
    For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
    Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
    In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.
    You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.
    If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

<!-------------------------------------------------deployment MISSING-------->
Deployment
    This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).
    In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
    Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
    Different configuration files?
    Separate git branch?
    In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
